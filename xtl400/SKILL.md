# XTL's AS/400

**First rule: ask the box.** Vendor documentation, web search and plausible
reasoning each lost to a single query on 2026-09-16 — five times in one day. This
estate is thirty years old, two product generations behind, and split across two
partitions whose roles swap. Every external source describes something adjacent
to it rather than it.

## Where the specifics live

This skill is the **method and the traps**. The estate's current facts live in
the repos, and duplicating them here would guarantee drift:

| Need | Go to |
|---|---|
| Hostnames, roles, serials | `proj-as400-codemap/tools/boxes.tsv` |
| Saved queries + the runners | `proj-as400-codemap/tools/` |
| Measurements, with their caveats | `proj-as400-codemap/docs/research/index.md` |
| Decisions (read-only boundary, storage, scope) | `proj-as400-codemap/docs/adr/` |
| Extracted source, captures | `kb-xtl400/` |
| IBM i / RPG / CL platform reference | `kb-ibm400` (MCP-exposed) |
| Security posture, findings, the access wall | `proj-security` — **counts and pointers only** |

## Connecting

**Credentials come from SOPS, never a plaintext file, and the profile is a
per-project choice.** `x400 <profile> <command>` decrypts one profile out of
`homelab-secrets` `secrets/home/xtl400.sops.yaml` and exports
`XTL400_USER`/`XTL400_PASSWORD` for that command only. That file is scoped to
the **admin age key alone** — no unattended host decrypts an XTL production
credential. Use the `secrets` skill to add or rotate one.

```bash
x400 ccsec sql400 "SELECT ..."                    # proj-security, curlib DOUGSEC
x400 ccimg ./tools/q400 primary whoami            # proj-as400-codemap
XTL400_HOST=192.168.40.20 x400 ccsec sql400 "..."  # the target; default is primary
```

**Pick the profile that matches the work.** `CCSEC` is proj-security's;
`CCIMG` is the mapping project's. They are separate so that `QAUDJRN`
attributes a read to the project that made it — a shared profile destroys
that, and on this estate the audit trail is itself under review.

**Whoever you connect as, you are inside the finding.** `CCIMG` is `*USER`
with no special authorities but `LMTCPB(*NO)`, and this box's `*PUBLIC`
posture gives update or delete on 80,454 files — so a "read-only" session is
read-only by *discipline*, not by constraint. Never rely on the profile to
stop a write. (proj-security #20.)

Needs the profile enabled by Doug plus Zscaler — **access is interactive, not
unattended**. Never echo a credential; `x400` keeps it in the environment of
one child process.

## Two partitions, and the roles swap

There is no "the box". There is a **primary** and a **target**, and which
machine holds which role changes. They have already swapped once (workload moved
end of May 2026) and the target is scheduled for replacement.

- **`xtl400.xtl.com` follows the role**, so it is always the primary.
- **Bind to roles, never hostnames.** A tool that names a machine is wrong at the
  next swap and wrong *silently* — it keeps returning plausible numbers from the
  wrong box.
- **Provenance records the serial**, not just the role: "the target, in October"
  and "the target, in January" are different machines.

### Which work goes where

| Work | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Catalog, inventory, resolution | **primary** | it describes what runs |
| `QHST` / system history | **primary** | per-partition; not replicated |
| Security system values | **both** | per-partition — the *diff* is the finding |
| Journal receiver reads | **target** | where receivers land; offloads the primary |
| Bulk source reads, expensive scans | **target** | the primary runs the business |

**Usage statistics are per-partition and are NOT replicated.** A replicated
object arrives with its creation date and content and *no* usage history. This is
why counters can look "wiped" on one box while eight years of them sit on the
other. Never read a last-used date without knowing which partition produced it.

## The read-only boundary

Nothing here changes anything on the box, with named exceptions
(`proj-as400-codemap/docs/adr/0007`):

- **`QTEMP` scratch is permitted, standing.** It is job-scoped and destroyed at
  disconnect. This is what makes `DSPPGMREF`/`DSPDBR` reachable at all — they are
  commands with no SQL equivalent.
- **Persistent writes need per-case approval**, and are done by **programs on the
  box** (scheduled, logged, stoppable by XTL) rather than by a session reaching in.
- Use `./tools/cmd400`, which enforces a fixed allow-list of display commands and
  refuses anything else without contacting the box. Do not widen it casually.

## Release 7.3 traps

Both partitions are 7.3 (upgrade expected; re-probe after). 7.3 rejects
statements that are valid on newer releases, and the errors do not say "old
release":

| Trap | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `ORDER BY … NULLS LAST` rejected | `CASE WHEN col IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, col` |
| `GROUP BY 1` (ordinals) rejected | repeat the expression, or a derived table |
| `SYSMEMBERSTAT` absent (7.5 TR4 / 7.4 TR10) | `SYSPARTITIONSTAT`, or `DSPFD TYPE(*MBRLIST)` to `QTEMP` |
| `SYSFILES` absent (7.4+) | `OBJECT_STATISTICS`, `DSPFD` |
| `SOURCE_STREAM_FILE_PATH` absent | n/a on this estate |

Also, independent of release:

- The column is **`SOURCE_FILE_MEMBER`**, not `SOURCE_MEMBER`.
- **Join on `SYSTEM_TABLE_SCHEMA`/`_NAME`/`_MEMBER`**, never the SQL-name
  columns — a library like `@20210312` gets a generated SQL name and silently
  fails to match.
- Compare **`LAST_SOURCE_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP`**, not `LAST_CHANGE_TIMESTAMP`, which
  moves on copy, reorganise, restore and replication apply.
- Sub-second fields are always zero; compile timestamps are second-grain.
  Truncate before comparing and expect ties.
- **Key everything library + file + member.** Member names repeat across source
  files in one library.

## Running SQL from a source member (`RUNSQLSTM`)

Three defaults conspire to make a working member fail with an error that points
at the wrong line. All three cost an afternoon on 2026-09-18.

- **`MARGINS` defaults to columns 1–80** and the rest of each record is dropped
  silently. Source files here are `SRCDTA CHAR(100)`, so an 84-character
  `INSERT INTO t (a, b, c)` loses `, c)` — and the parse error lands on the
  **next** record (`SQL0104 … token X was not valid`, naming a token that is
  fine). **Always pass `MARGINS(100)`**, or match the file's `SRCDTA` length.
- **`OUTPUT` defaults to `*NONE`.** Per-statement messages go **only to the
  listing**, never to the job log — the job log gets a bare `SQL9010 … command
  failed` and, via `QCMDEXC`, a useless `SQL0443`. **Always `OUTPUT(*PRINT)`.**
- **The listing spool is printed and deleted** by the writer (and is destroyed
  outright if the job ends abnormally). To read it, override first, in the same
  job: `OVRPRTF FILE(QSYSPRT) HOLD(*YES) OUTQ(QUSRSYS/QEZJOBLOG) OVRSCOPE(*JOB)`
  — **`OVRSCOPE(*JOB)` is required**, because each `QSYS2.QCMDEXC` call runs at
  its own call level and a default-scoped override is gone by the next one.
  The listing lands in `<profile>/QPRTJOB` named after the member, not the
  running job; find it with `QSYS2.SPOOLED_FILE_INFO` and read it with
  `SYSTOOLS.SPOOLED_FILE_DATA`. Errors are the last few records, under a
  `MSG ID  SEV  RECORD  TEXT` header.

**Do not "fix" this by raising `ERRLVL`.** `ERRLVL(30)` makes the command
succeed by tolerating genuine SQL errors, so statements are skipped and the run
looks complete. Keep `ERRLVL(20)` and read the listing.

`sql400` runs every `;`-separated statement on **one connection**, so a
`CALL QSYS2.QCMDEXC(...)` and a follow-up `QSYS2.JOBLOG_INFO('*')` or
`SPOOLED_FILE_INFO` in the same invocation see the same job. It keeps going
after a failed statement (printing `!! [SQLnnnn] …` to stderr) and exits 1.

## Costs, measured

- Estate-wide `*PGM` scan: ~25 s (target), ~90 s (primary).
- Estate-wide all-object-type scan: **~11 minutes** — put it on the target.
- Estate-wide member scan (`SYSPARTITIONSTAT`): ~2 minutes. Drive it library at
  a time.
- `DSPPGMREF` over a 4,400-program library: **~1 second.** The whole reference
  graph is minutes, not hours.
- Reading source members one at a time: ~1.7 s each via a JVM-per-member helper.
  Do not loop it over thousands.
- **`HISTORY_LOG_INFO` over 4 days: ~12 minutes even filtered to six message IDs.**
  The log runs ~1.4M messages/day, and the filter is applied after retrieval.
  Always pass `START_TIME`/`END_TIME`, keep the window hours not days, and expect
  it to be slow anyway.
- `DISPLAY_JOURNAL` for one file over 6 hours: **under a second.** Cheap — but see
  the attribution trap below.

## Blind spots that make confident answers wrong

- **An `*ALLUSR` sweep silently omits every library the profile cannot reach,
  and reports it as absence.** `QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('*ALLUSR', ...)`
  returns zero rows for an object that plainly exists, with **no error and no
  warning** — the job log carries a `CPF2182 Not authorized to library X` that
  the SQL result never mentions. Measured 2026-09-18: a sweep for `IMPSEID`
  came back empty and was reported as "does not exist anywhere on the box";
  it exists in `SEIOBJ` and `ZPETERP`, both `CPF2182` to `CCIMG`.
  **"Not found" from a sweep means "not found *where I can see*".** Say which
  libraries were excluded, or do not make a negative claim at all.
  The libraries still appear in `QSYS2.SYSSCHEMAS` — the catalog lists them
  while object access is refused, so schema visibility is not evidence of
  object visibility (`proj-security` ADR 0003 is the same distinction).
  Known refused to `CCIMG` so far: `SEIOBJ`, `ZPETERP`, `QRDARS`, `XTLBC`.
  Check the job log for `CPF2182` after any sweep that returns less than
  expected.

- **`*QRYDFN` — thousands of them, with no source at all.** Query/400 definitions
  are invisible to every source-driven approach, and they are scheduled in
  production (`RUNQRY` appears in the job schedule). Count them before claiming
  coverage.
- **`DSPPGMREF` cannot see** call targets held in variables (`*EXPR`), files
  reached through `OVRDBF`, runtime-built program names, `QCMDEXC` command
  strings, or dynamic SQL.
- **~23% of raw `DSPPGMREF` edges are IBM language runtime** (`QLEAWI`, `QRNX*`,
  `QCLSRV`, blank object type). Filter them or they dominate the graph.
- **`PROGRAM_INFO` carries source for OPM only.** ILE records it on the *module* —
  union `BOUND_MODULE_INFO` or you will report most of the estate as sourceless.
- **Embedded-SQL programs** record the precompiler's `QTEMP/QSQLTEMP1` member,
  which evaporated. Indistinguishable from lost source unless filtered.
- **Renamed source files.** A program library does *not* draw from one matching
  source library — one sampled library used ten. And a renamed source file made
  441 members look lost that were not. **Resolve renames by following the
  failures**; a name-pattern sweep (`%OLD`, `%BAK`) finds almost nothing.
- **Journal attribution is lost in replication.** Reading a journal on the
  *target* returns MIMIX's apply program (`DMAPPLY`/`ICC_DBAPYA`/`MIMIXOWN`), not
  the program that made the change. **Read journals on the `primary` for
  attribution** — the opposite of where you send expensive scans. And the primary
  keeps only ~2 days of receivers, so usable observed-use depth is days, not weeks.
- **`OBJATTRIBUTE = 'DFU'` means there is no source and never was.** DFU generates
  a program from an interactive definition. Alongside vendor products, the second
  explainable-absence class — and it is exactly the set with no recorded source
  library. Check the attribute before calling anything's source lost.
- **`SYSPARTITIONSTAT` silently hides what you cannot read.** This is the worst
  one, because it looks like data rather than a permission error. Objects the
  profile lacks authority to are **omitted with no error and no flag** — so
  "member absent" quietly means "absent *or* invisible to me". It produced a
  report that 1,435 production programs had lost their source when the source was
  simply behind an authority wall.

  **`OBJECT_STATISTICS` is the instrument that distinguishes them:** it returns
  an unauthorised object **with blank `OBJOWNER`, `OBJSIZE` and `OBJTEXT`**,
  while readable siblings show real values. Genuine absence is the object not
  being returned at all.

  So resolve existence through `OBJECT_STATISTICS`, and classify **four** states,
  never three: readable · **present-but-unauthorised** · renamed · absent.

## Products on the estate

Check the box for versions rather than assuming; all three are behind current.

- **Robot/SCHEDULE** — the real job scheduler (IBM's is near-empty). Its files are
  externally described *with field text*, so `SYSCOLUMNS` on the live library is a
  working data dictionary — better than the vendor's manuals, which describe a
  much newer release. Version is in data area `ROBOTLIB/RBTIVER`; find the live
  library from the running monitor job, not from the library name.
- **MIMIX** — replication. Replicates object content, **not** usage statistics.
  Role swaps are why counters restart.
- **BRMS** — backup, and a possible route to *old versions of source*, which the
  box itself does not keep.

## Before you report a number

1. Which partition produced it, and does that matter for this claim?
2. Does it cover ILE as well as OPM?
3. Is a blind spot above excluded from it, and is that stated?
4. Can it be re-derived from a saved query rather than cited?

`docs/research/index.md` keeps an explicit list of figures that are **not**
measured. Add to it rather than quietly promoting an estimate.
